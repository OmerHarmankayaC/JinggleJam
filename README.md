### ❓ Quick questions to improve it further:
1. **What does JinggleJam actually do?** (music app, game, visualizer, event site, etc.)
2. Is this a **school project, personal experiment, or production app**?
3. Do you want to add:
   - Screenshots?
   - Live demo link?
   - API/backend info?
   - Contribution guidelines?

Answer these and I’ll refine the README to look **professional & unique**, not just a template.
